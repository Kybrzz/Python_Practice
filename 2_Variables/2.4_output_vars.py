# print is a 'function' used to output vars 
x = "Python is ...gr8"
print(x) 

## can also use print function to output several vars seperated by a comma
a = "Python"
b = " is " # account for spaces 
c = "gr8" 
print(a, b, c) 
print(a + b + c) # same result as above print function 

### +, when dealing w/ numbers, acts as a summation operator 
p = 20 
q = 6 
print(p + q) 

#### optimal way to output several vars is via comma seperation 
r = 4
h = "Stone"
print(r, h)
